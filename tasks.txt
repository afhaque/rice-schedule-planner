BACK-END:
  - Needs to properly save user data when a push request is received.

FRONT-END COMMUNICATION:
  - XHTTPRequests need to be re-tried on failure.
  - Currently push requests are duplicated (e.g. one for remove from schedule one for add to playground).
  - User interface should be unusuable until both the courses and user model have been loaded.
  - User interface should be made unusable when a push request fails due to session or XSRF timeout.
  - User interface should be made unusable when a push request fails due to any unknown reason.
  - User model needs method to update hasSeenTour; update should push to server.
  - SchedulePlannerController and SchedulePlannerXhrController need some event-based communication mechanism.

FRONT-END:
  HIGH PRIORITY:
    - Times that cannot be rendered on the calendar should not be returned by CourseModel::getMeetingTimes, or the
      calendar should be able to account for invalid times and not draw them. Currently, index out of bounds errors
      are resulting from this problem (see CourseModel, CalendarLayout).

  MEDIUM PRIORITY:
    - CourseModel needs to be updated to properly use all of the information from the underlying protocol message.
      Currently, some of the data is still hard-coded. Additional methods may need to be added.

    - Usability Improvement: When the calendar view contains no items, it should show instructions for the user to
      drag a view from the playground onto the calendar.

    - Usability Improvement: When the playground view contains no items, it should show instructions for the user to
      drag a view from the search view onto the playground.

    - Usability Improvement: When the search view is open but has no results to display, instructions should be shown
      to the user on how to use the search system (filters, drag results into playground, etc).

    - Implement the drop guide views on the calendar to show for all sessions of the provided course when any section
      is picked up (see AbstractCourseView, CourseModel::getAllSections). Note: CourseModel::getAllSections should be
      rewritten to no longer use futures.

    - Implement the navigation bar (NavigationBarView). The bar should display the user's network ID, a title, a logout
      link (to /logout), and a help link that will bring up the tour (TourView).

    - Implement TourView, an interactive slideshow that explains how to use the application. The tour should be shown
      to each user automatically the first time they view the application, and should not be shown on subsequent visits.
      You can check against or set the value of hasSeenTour on the UserModel.

    - Implement search functionality (SearchView). This can be done entirely client-side by adding Search API calls to
      CoursesModel and using them to update the SearchView when the user changes filters or types in the text field.

    - Implement the CourseModalView, a popup which displays information about a given course.

    - Show the number of credits in schedule on the toolbar (broken down for all, D1, D2, D3).

    - Add an option to export courses for registration (just a pop-up with a list of CRNs that ESTHER requires). This
      option should be clickable from the Toolbar.

    - Add right-click context menu to all course views in calendar and playground w/ options:
      * Remove (removes the course from either the calendar or playground)
      * View Evaluations (brings up the course evalations page within ESTHER)
      * View Information (brings a course modal view for the given course)

  LOW PRIORITY:
    - Add a list view (similar to the previous schedule planner) so that students can use either view.

    - Certain courses cannot be displayed on the calendar because they are not scheduled (e.g. research courses).
      We need to come up with a way to allow these courses to be scheduled. These courses also usually have
      variable credit hours.

    - Categorization should also take into account cross-listing.
